## Usage

* Next to name, add the name of the armature
* Choose which parts to add (Arms, Legs, Feet, Eyes)
* Click on 'Add advanced rig'
* If you choose to add a rig for the feet, you need to do a bit of bone positioning
    * 'ctrl_pivot_toe' should be positioned at the front of the toes
    * 'ctrl_heel' should be positioned at the back of the heel
    * the heads and tails of the 'mch_roll_in' and 'mch_roll_out' bones should be positioned at the inner and outerside of the foot
    * Note that you do not need to worry about both sides, since x-mirror will be turned on!
* Once the feet bones are positioned, press the 'Finish foot rig' button in the 'Finish' subpanel
